# ParticleSim
A Python GUI for visual, interactive simulations of physics concepts. This GUI uses the pygame library. 

# Requirements to Run
- Python 3
- pygame

# How to Run It
To run the GUI, git clone this repository and then run main.py, which is the main menu to get to all the GUI cases. To go back from any specific point-particle simulation case, just exit out of the GUI by clicking the red X button, and you will be back to the main menu. To toggle between dark and light mode, just press the D-Key on the main menu!

# Helping Out
If you want to make another point-particle simulation case, make sure to add that as a different class in the SimCases folder
